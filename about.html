<p>
    The area was oroginally settled by early hunter gatherers around 6,000 B.C. Researchers have found evodence of Bronze Age bridges and Iron age forts near the River Thames.
    Ancient Romans founded a port and trading settlement called Londinium in 43 A.D, a few years later a bridge was constructed across the Thames
    to facilitate commerce and troop movements. But in 60 A.D celtic queen Bondica led an army to sack the city which was burned to the ground in the first of many
    fires to destroy London. The city was soon rebuilt, but burned again about 125 A.D, more rebuilding occured and within afew generations the population exceeded 40,000
    people. Aftre the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D, however the city was attacked numbers of times by vikingd and other raiders and soon London was largely abandoned
    There is so much more to know about the history of London like knowing the reasons who the rome fell, when London burned down in 1666.
